# Ontario-Carbon-Tracker

## Inspiration

Climate change is a critical issue, and there are many everyday actions we could all take to help protect our environment. Our project provides a bridge for every one of us to take small but significant steps to contribute.

## What it does

Get your carbon emissions amount based on your household's:
- Electricity usage
- Water usage
- Fuel consumption
- Car usage
- Food items and weights

## How we built it

- Figma: prototype of webpage frontend
- Flask: web application development

## Challenges we ran into

- Learning new technology stacks
- Finding relevant and proper data to perform calculations

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Built a prototype using Figma using what was learned in the hackathon workshop
- Built the web application using Flask

## What we learned

- How to turn an idea into a product
- Collaborating between teammates remotely
- Soft and technical skills

## What's next for Ontario Carbon Tracker

- Incorporate real-time tracking of the inputs so that the user won't have to manually input values
- Expand data to outside of Ontario
